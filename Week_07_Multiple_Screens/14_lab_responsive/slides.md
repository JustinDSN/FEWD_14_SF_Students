How to make a website responsive.

##Level One

*	Size fonts in ems
*	Identify columns that can be stacked

##Level Two

*	Determine what content is extra
	*	Does that h1 need an h2 under it?
	*	Will that one liner get the visitor to understand my site or is it extra?

*	Determine what content needs to be visible
	*	Is it necessary to show my entire nav if there are other ways of getting to navigation?

*	Identify extra styling
	*	Do my columns need a border if theyâ€™re stacked?
